        content: >
          The party has been summoned to meet with the mayor, Hamish Grindle.
          He can be found at the government residence, a vast mansion overlooking the sea.
          Grindle is a human man (noble) with delusions of grandeur. Grindle’s main concern
          about the missing men is that they are needed to work and keep the economy going.
          He is dismissive of the ‘emotional’ concerns of women whose family members are missing.
          He tells the group that when the fish started disappearing about 10 weeks ago, the men
          went further out to sea and started to disappear.

          Hamish offers the group a substantial reward (500 gp, with 250 gp up front) if they can figure
          out where the men have gone and stop it from happening again. Hamish directs them to the
          Shrivelled Barnacle, a tavern popular with seafaring types right near the harbour, to find a ship
          and crew. If the group contains any men, Hamish directs all of his commentary to them. If the
          group is comprised solely of women, he treats them dismissively, and it’s clear he believes they
          cannot solve the problem but allows them to try anyway.

      - name: Canticle Bay Description
        content: >
          Canticle Bay is a bustling port town. Warm wind blows off the sea, moving the palm trees
          further into town. The houses are mostly are pulled from the market by the sea to edge of town,
          to head off to the inland communities. At night, you can hear what sounds like bay. Locals call
          it "the cry of the sea."

      - name: The Shrivelled Barnacle
        content: >
          When they arrive at the Shrivelled Barnacle, the characters interrupt an escalating argument.
          Two people stand in the middle of the room, with the crowd circled around them. One is Rax
          Vander (veteran), a burly combative half orc, shaking a fist in her opponent’s face. The opponent
          is Yorin Handal (noble), a weaselly looking half-elf, dressed in fine clothes. They are arguing
          about whose ship is better. Rax shouts about her sailing prowess, and taunts Yorin for the loss
          of two of his crew members last week. The crowd heckles her, shouting that women aren’t made
          to sail. Her two dwarven crew members (scouts) toss insults back at the crowd. Yorin brags of
          the speed and size of his ship, boasting that it’s the newest and finest you can buy along the coast.
          His sizeable crew of young men backs him up.

          If the characters don’t step in, the barkeep will eventually break up the argument. Rax, Yorin, and
          their respective crews move to opposite sides of the tavern, glaring at each other. If the characters
          do step in, the NPCs they defend thank them when the dust settles. If the characters divulge their
          mission, each captain offers to accompany the group for a fee.

          What Rax Knows
          If the characters speak with Rax, she reveals the following information:
          • She arrived in Canticle Bay to assist in finding the missing men, but everyone has refused to hire her.
          • She has a small sloop-type ship (see "Keelboat Stats," Chapter 9, DMG) that she plans to use to
            explore the sea and islands around Canticle Bay.
          • She has been investigating the singing and knows the general area it comes from.
          • She will accompany them on their mission for 40 gp (halved if they stepped in to defend her during
            the argument).

          What Yorin Knows
          If the characters speak with Yorin, he reveals the following information:
          • His father has outfitted him with the most expensive ship, a galleon type ship (see Chapter 9, DMG),
            less than a year old, and the best crew money can buy.
          • His ship can withstand almost any monster the sea has to offer.
          • He’s heard rumour of survivors taking refuge on an island.
          • He will accompany them on their mission for 100 gp (halved if they stepped in to defend him during
            the argument).

          Whomever the characters choose, the captain and their crew escort the characters to their ship in the
          harbour, and plans are made to set out at dawn the next day.

      - name: Travel to the Islands
        content: >
          In this chapter, characters can explore the sea and islands around Canticle Bay by ship, while searching
          for the men and/or the beast(s) who took them. The ease of exploring Canticle Bay depends on which
          captain the group has hired. If they hired Rax, her small boat easily navigates in and around islands,
          allowing the crew to come up nearly to the shore. However, it is more susceptible to bad weather or
          attacks by large sea monsters. If they hired Yorin, the boat easily withstands bad weather and deflects
          monsters, but it must be moored a significant distance from the islands, making it more difficult to explore
          or make a hasty getaway if necessary. The weather on the sea can be unpredictable. If you would like to
          include weather as a factor, refer to the weather table in Chapter 5, "Adventure Environments" (DMG).

          Environmental destruction and ocean collapse from overfishing are easily seen while exploring the area
          around the bay. Characters might see collapsing or dead coral reef, little to no fish or marine life, and
          limited birds. While exploring the islands, a siren scout may investigate (see the siren’s stat block on
          pg. 20). She can lead the players in the right direction, or may use her luring song to try and capture
          any men in the party.

          Two islands are outlined below in more detail, but, if the party wants to explore more, roll on the chart
          for things found on or near islands around Canticle Bay:
          1. 2d4 + 1 dolphins surround and swim with the boat, begging for food (see the dolphin stat block on
             pg. 20).
          2. An island that is an inactive volcano. A band of monkeys (apes, each with 9 HP) live on the island,
             and they constantly try to steal things from the party.
          3. An island that is home to a sahuagin priestess and her followers. They may try to recruit the party
             into their cult.
          4. A corrupted island that is home to a lonely sea hag. She is grateful for the visitors, and may try to
             trick them into staying.
          5. A mother plesiosaur aggressively defends her two babies when the boat gets too close.
          6. A message in a bottle floats near the boat or the shore of an island. The message contains a treasure
             map. Following the map leads to a child’s toys buried in the sand (a bag of marbles, strangely shaped
             rocks, and a small wood carving of a ship).
